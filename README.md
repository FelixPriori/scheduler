# Interview Scheduler

Scheduler is a full stack, single page React app which uses PostgreSQL and Axios, and was tested with Storybook, Jest and Cypress. 

Scheduler allows students to book and manage interviews with an interviewer. While creating the appointment, the student can enter their name and choose an interviewer, which they can edit, or delete after saving.

This app was made by Felix Rioux Sabourin in March 2020, on week 7 & 8 of [Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.ca/)'s 12 weeks web bootcamp.
